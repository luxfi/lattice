  - `basics`: an example showcasing the basic capabilities of the bootstrapping.
  - `high_precision`: an example showcasing high-precision bootstrapping.
  - `slim`: an example showcasing slim bootstrapping, i.e. re-ordering the steps of the bootstrapping.

- `reals_scheme_switching`: an example showcasing scheme switching between `ckks` and `rgsw` to complement fixed-point arithmetic with lookup tables.
- `reals_sigmoid_chebyshev`: an example showcasing polynomial evaluation of a Chebyshev approximation of the sigmoid.
- `reals_sigmoid_minimax`: an example showcasing polynomial evaluation of a minimax approximation of the sigmoid.
- `reals_vectorized_polynomial_evaluation`: an example showcasing vectorized polynomial evaluation, i.e. evaluating different polynomials in parallel on specific slots.

## Templates

Templates are files containing the basic instantiation, i.e. parameters, key-generation, encoding, encryption and decryption.

- `reals`: a template for `ckks`.
- `int`: a template for `bgv`.

## Tutorials

Tutorials are examples showcasing the basic capabilities of the library.

- `reals`: a tutorial on all the basic capabilities of the package `ckks`.

# Multiparty-HE Examples

 - `int_psi`: an example showcasing the $N\text{-out-of-}N$-threshold scheme in a *private set intersection* scenario.
 - `int_pir`: an example showcasing the $t\text{-out-of-}N$-threshold scheme in a *private information retrieval* scenario.
 - `thresh_eval_key_gen`: an example showcasing the generation of a large set of evaluation-keys in the $t\text{-out-of-}N$-threshold scheme.

## Parameters

The `params.go` file contains several sets of example parameters for both `bgv` and `ckks`.
These parameter are chosen to represent several degrees of homomorphic capacity for a fixed 128-bit security
(according to the standard estimates at the time of writing). They do not represent a set of default parameters 
to be used in real HE applications. Rather, they are meant to facilitate quick tests and experimentation 
with the library.
